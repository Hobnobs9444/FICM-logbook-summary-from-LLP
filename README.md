# FICM-logbook-summary-from-LLP
Creates a FICM Logbook Summary from a Lifelong Learning Platform logbook export. 
Useful for Dual Anaesthetics and ICM Trainees in the UK who maintain an LLP Anaesthetics logbook but need to produce reports for ICM ARCPs. 

1. Export LLP logbook as excel file
3. Save the python script and logbook in same directory
4. Change filename varible to match the excel sheet filename
5. Change start_date and end_date for date filtered report
6. Running the script

## Webapp
Uses an older version of the script which doesn't incorporate date selection - so delete rows manually for unwanted date periods prior to running the script
